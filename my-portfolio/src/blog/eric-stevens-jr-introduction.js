        <h2>Introduction: The Man Behind the Mission</h2>
        <p>I've faced war, failure, heartbreak, and the edge of my own destruction. I refuse to let life dictate my path. I'm in control now.</p>
        <p>My name is Eric Stevens Jr. I am from St. Augustine, Florida, born into a long line of locals. I live by discipline, execution, and mastery 
            in every pursuit. I'm a businessman, a thinker, and a builder, constantly seeking growth.
        </p>
        <p>I am a U.S. Army Infantry combat veteran who served in Afghanistan, along with training alongside our European and Eastern European allies. 
            My life isn't about comfort or compromise - it's a pursuit of excellence. I haven't always lived according to my current values, 
            but I believe that anyone can change the moment they decide to, with the discipline to follow through. 
        </p>

        <h2>My Philosophy: How I Live and Why It Works</h2>
        <p>My life is built on the pillars of <strong>Stoicism</strong> and <strong>lifelong learning</strong>. In my younger years, 
            I made too many decisions based on emotion. I let anger dictate my choices, and it cost me everything - my relationships, finances, and focus. 
            I learned the hard way that emotion is a fire: controlled, it can drive you; unchecked, it burns your life down. 
            That's why I made the decision to master logic, discipline, and absolute control over my actions. 
            The two most important traits a man can develop are <strong>emotional intelligence and self-control</strong>. With these, you can make 
            decisions based on logic and strategy - this is the key to success.
        </p>
        <p>I also believe in <strong>absolute ownership</strong>. Blaming external factors weakens you. Owning every result, good or bad, makes you stronger. 
            I used to blame others - my circumstances, my past, my environment. I learned this the hard way when I was spiraling in PTSD and depression 
            after I left the Army and lost my purpose. This external blaming destroyed my relationships and everything I had built up to that point. 
            At that moment, I could have made excuses or gave up, but instead, I owned it. I took accountability for everything - even what wasn't mine 
            to carry. That decision made me stronger - I've never looked back.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Adversity fuels growth</strong>. Failure teaches. Obstacles force adaptation. <strong>Daily training</strong> - 
            mentally and physically - arms you for whatever comes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Analysis paralysis</strong> held me back for too long. Now, I move first, adjust as I go, and refine through struggle. 
            Execution beats perfection - always.
        </p>
        <p><strong>I don't seek approval - my values validate me.</strong> If you live by your own code, you'll never need validation from anyone.</p>
