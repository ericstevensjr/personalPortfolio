          I’m a Florida native with deep roots in St. Augustine, where my family has called home for over 300 years and where I call home to this day. Raised with blue-collar values of hard work and resilience, I carried those principles with me through my service and early life as an Infantryman in the U.S. Army in which I had multiple deployments to Afghanistan and Eastern Europe. My time in the military shaped my approach to life and business, driving me to constantly seek new challenges and overcome any adversity I can with a smile on my face.

          After completing my military service, I transitioned into the world of technology, earning my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from the University of North Florida. Since then, I’ve embraced life as a serial entrepreneur, diving into various industries where I've studied, developed software, and crafted solutions. Whether in tech, sports, fishing, or dog training, I apply the same determination and creativity to everything I do.

          Beyond business, I’m deeply involved in my community. I coach youth sports, stay active in the outdoors, and maintain a love for history, art, and fitness. I also enjoy life’s competitive edge through sports betting and investing, always eager to challenge myself both mentally and physically in every area of life.

          I’m passionate about advocating for children’s welfare and rights, environmental sustainability, veterans' welfare and rights, gun rights, and equality for all Americans. These causes are close to my heart and influence the work I do and the way I live my life.
