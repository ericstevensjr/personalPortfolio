        About Me

        <p className="text-center text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
          Born and raised in St. Augustine, Florida, I come from a long line of men who built their lives with their hands and their minds. My family has 
          called this place home for over 300 years, and I carry that legacy forward with the same grit, determination, and blue-collar work ethic I was 
          raised with.

          I served as an Infantryman in the U.S. Army, deploying to Afghanistan and working alongside our European allies. Those years shaped me. 
          They taught me that comfort is the enemy of growth and that discipline is the key to survival—not just in combat, but in life. I learned to 
          think under pressure, act without hesitation, and never back down from adversity.
        </p>
        <p className="text-center text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mt-4">
          After the military, I transitioned into the world of <strong>technology and business</strong>, earning my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. 
          I don’t just work in tech—I build. I analyze inefficiencies, develop streamlined solutions, and execute without excuse. Whether in software 
          development, automation, or AI-driven systems, my approach remains the same: lean, efficient, and built for results. 
        </p>
        <p className="text-center text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mt-4">
          Beyond business, I believe in <strong>self-mastery</strong>. I train in <strong>martial arts and defensive tactics</strong>, because a man should
           be capable. I study <strong>history, philosophy, and strategy</strong>, because a man should be sharp. I hunt, fish, and explore the outdoors, 
           because a man should know how to survive. Everything I do is driven by one mission: to build a life of absolute strength, control, and purpose.
        </p>
        <p className="text-center text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mt-4">
          My philosophy is simple: <strong>ownership over everything</strong>. No excuses. No waiting for opportunities—only taking them. 
          <strong>Adversity is fuel.Discipline is freedom. Execution beats perfection.</strong> I don’t chase approval, I chase results.
        </p>

          bigger than yourself, I want to work with you and build something together. Please, get in contact at anytime for any reason.
